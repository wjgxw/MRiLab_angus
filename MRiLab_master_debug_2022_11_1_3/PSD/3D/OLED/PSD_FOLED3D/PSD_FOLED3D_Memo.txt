=====================================
Note: 
For FSE:to satisfy CPMG condition and acquire signal at the center of two consecutive refocusing pulse, TE must be (floor(FSE_ETL/2)+1)*FSE_ESP.
For OLED:Shift gradient should be well designed, modify if necessary. CV10 and CV11 control the gradient level.
