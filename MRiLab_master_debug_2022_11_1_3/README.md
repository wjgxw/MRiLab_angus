### A Numerical Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Simulation Platform

https://leoliuf.github.io/MRiLab/

The MRiLab is a numerical MRI simulation package. It has been developed and optimized to simulate MR signal formation, k-space acquisition and MR image reconstruction. MRiLab provides several dedicated toolboxes to analyze RF pulse, design MR sequence, configure multiple transmitting and receiving coils, investigate magnetic field related properties and evaluate real-time imaging technique. The main MRiLab simulation platform combined with those toolboxes can be applied to customize various virtual MR experiments which can serve as a prior stage for prototyping and testing new MR technique and application.

The main portal for access to source code and documentation is the [GitHub][1]. If you find MRiLab useful for the publication of any scientific results, please cite this [paper][2]: 

"*Fast Realistic MRI Simulations Based on Generalized Multi-Pool Exchange Tissue Model*. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging. 2016. doi: 10.1109/TMI.2016.2620961"

**MRiLab v1.3** is now available, with new features of:
  >- Support multi-pool exchange tissue model 
  >- Provide simulation in batch mode 
  >- Provide spatial SAR and power evaluation 
  >- Polish graphical interface
  >- More...
